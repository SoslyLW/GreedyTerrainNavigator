# Greedy Terrain Navigator
This program runs multiple terrain navigation algorithms on topological data from NOAA to find the path of least elevation change. Algorithms include multiple greedy searches and a stay-low elevation search. The programs evaluates the best option from each potential starting point on the left and highlights the most optimal route.

Below are screenshots of the program running:
